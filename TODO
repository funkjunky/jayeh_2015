 - Create features for blog posts
	- create a ParallaxHeader component that takes an image, and otherwise renders what’s inside it. it well create a parallex effect as the user scrolls down.
		- fill in todo here…
	- the default value of the header text area should be a BlogHeader component with an empty image attribute with a p tag inside the component with “Hello World” written in it
	- button near title input to default header to a parallex of title
	- add drag and drop to body text area that upload an image, then places an <img /> tag inside the body with the url of the uploaded image.
	- add drag and drop to the header text area that uploads an image, then replaces BlogHeader image=“” with the image url

	- add autosaving to local storage

	- create Sidenote component like Ars’s Game Details on the right or left. You specify the left or right and the width [defaults: right, 200]. The inside is the html

	- add preview for the body textarea
	- add very nice default font sizes and formatting for article… now that I have preview I should be able to ensure everything looks incredible
		- pre-wrap so new lines show
		- find a nice type font
		- ensure font size is appropriate
		- ensure images and their captions look beautiful
	- ensure the main article page looks incredibly nice with header.
	- add a preview link above the header textarea to preview the whole article, so you can see the header effect in a testing environment.
		- the url grabs the data from local storage to render

	- create a Definition component that when hovered provides a definition for a term on the spot. Word attribute is displayed, while the inside is the html for the definition.

 - Add responsive design setup, ensure it works on my ipad and iphone [doesn’t need to look that good, just be readable without scrolling left right or having to zoom]

 - Prettify front page
	- articles show header without parallax effect and with zoom out perhaps
		- summary items pass a prop “isFullPage” that the header html can use to pass to it’s components.
	- On mouseover the first bit of text is shown to give the user a preview with all tags stripped away.
	- format everything very nicely and add a splash of colour where it seems necessary.
	- add share button on top of main page article
