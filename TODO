	- add metadata (dates etc.)

	- make a new blog post celebrating my new blog
		- use an intro text… poppying text that is simple
		- write it out in a nice format, throw in lots of images
		- create a custom react element to show off the power i have

	- link jayeh.com and jayeh.ca to heroku jayeh

	- test out oauth on jayeh.ca and jayeh.com

	*free to program other stuff*

	- try creating a worm, then a me in pixel art, to use with oauth icon and favicon. [oauth icon is 120x120]

	 - have a single database entry point. A function that get a dbh and use that EVERYWHERE database is needed or passed or created. [this burned me during the first deployment]
	- use sessions to keep track of user:
		- setup session on login
		- on logout, remove session
		- route /login should redirect to /user/<username> is logged in
		- all auth routes should redirect to login if user isn’t in group “publisher” or doesn’t have super attribute.

	- character parallax [dude in a library!]
		- calculate dimensions of sprites to fit in header neatly. (imagine it)
		- make a pixel character of myself
		- get or make a nice set of book shelves i can use
		- place graphics on page
		- add scrolling effect that moves the character
		- create animations for character walking left and right
		- create different idling animations
			- left to right hand scanning books
			- tip toes, head left right
			- head tilt, maybe chin scratch
			- squat
		- implement the walking animations and idle animations
		- create an animation for grabbing a book and opening it
		- create an animation for scanning an open book
		- create an animation for flipping pages right to left
			- reverse it for the opposite?
		- create a sprite for an empty book spot, so I can grab a book and leave an empty spot.
		- implement the grabbing, scanning and flipping animations for articles
		~put additional ideas from book in this TODO later on.

	-Idea: a new way to blog with micro posts, eventually combined into a culminatory post? microposts would be like tweets. I would also tweet them and post them on facebook and G+, and they would be recorded in a collection. When i make a full blog post, I would select all microposts related.
		- somehow do something spectacular with the design…

	- add autosaving to local storage

	- create Sidenote component like Ars’s Game Details on the right or left. You specify the left or right and the width [defaults: right, 200]. The inside is the html

	- create a Definition component that when hovered provides a definition for a term on the spot. Word attribute is displayed, while the inside is the html for the definition.


 - Replace FeathersJS with my own socket and REST service. Has to be simpler and faster to develop with than FeathersJS without being ineffecient.


 - Add responsive design setup, ensure it works on my ipad and iphone [doesn’t need to look that good, just be readable without scrolling left right or having to zoom]

- add a preview link above the header textarea to preview the whole article, so you can see the header effect in a testing environment.
		- the url grabs the data from get parameters

 - Prettify front page
	- articles show header without parallax effect and with zoom out perhaps
		- summary items pass a prop “isFullPage” that the header html can use to pass to it’s components.
	- On mouseover the first bit of text is shown to give the user a preview with all tags stripped away.
	- format everything very nicely and add a splash of colour where it seems necessary.
	- add share button on top of main page article
		- when clicked, have animation of character text on a cell phone

 - Add my soundcloud likes to my website
	- create animations for character to listen to music when played
	- implement animation
