	- try markdown-it-highlightjs instead to auto get highlight js to work without didUpdate

 - Create features for blog posts
	- parallax markdown
		- add “react-parallax” 0.1.* to package.json
		- create an md plugin using react-parallax
		- test it out on edit, and fix plugin till it works

	- header should have a variable available to it $title, which is the value of the title field
		- i may need to make a markdown-it plugin to allow variables
	
	- create a figure/img/figcaption md plugin (BASIC! not jsx)
		- create the basic plugin as an ugly thing
		- add the styles for the html tags figure and figcaption and img

	- add drag and drop to body text area that uploads an image, then places the url where the carot is. Do the same for header as well!

	- add autosaving to local storage

	- create Sidenote component like Ars’s Game Details on the right or left. You specify the left or right and the width [defaults: right, 200]. The inside is the html

	- add preview for the body textarea
	- add very nice default font sizes and formatting for article… now that I have preview I should be able to ensure everything looks incredible
		- pre-wrap so new lines show
		- find a nice type font
		- ensure font size is appropriate
		- ensure images and their captions look beautiful
	- ensure the main article page looks incredibly nice with header.
	- add a preview link above the header textarea to preview the whole article, so you can see the header effect in a testing environment.
		- the url grabs the data from local storage to render

	- create a Definition component that when hovered provides a definition for a term on the spot. Word attribute is displayed, while the inside is the html for the definition.

 - Add responsive design setup, ensure it works on my ipad and iphone [doesn’t need to look that good, just be readable without scrolling left right or having to zoom]

 - Prettify front page
	- articles show header without parallax effect and with zoom out perhaps
		- summary items pass a prop “isFullPage” that the header html can use to pass to it’s components.
	- On mouseover the first bit of text is shown to give the user a preview with all tags stripped away.
	- format everything very nicely and add a splash of colour where it seems necessary.
	- add share button on top of main page article
